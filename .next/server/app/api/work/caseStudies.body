As a progressive association with more than 180+ members, their new branding had to be sleek, modern and accessible. Working closely with the internal team, we first design a logo and refined it through multiple feedback rounds. Through-out the rebranding project, the assets created included branding guidelines, design and development of the website, accessibility statement, official logos and appropriate variations in multiple file formats, regional affiliate logos and appropriate variations in multiple file formats, tradeshow and exhibition kiosk designs for domestic and international use, social media templates, powerpoint templates, email templates, letterheads, marketing collaterals such as banners, brochures, flyers, and designs for custom pins to be given out at the launch event. Leading up to the launch event at the Canadian Hydrogen Convention, we created a social media campaign to ensure the Canadian Hydrogen Association had the full attention of the industry.","url":"https://canadah2.ca/"},{"title":"Bridges","slug":"bridges","wip":true,"cover":"https://images.ctfassets.net/51r7zajk5f2o/3VyooH6Pc5s8vUo7HbsWp/777ecbba251e5cbbe2df44dae7eaea72/cover.png","icon":"https://images.ctfassets.net/51r7zajk5f2o/5qRdqGowtNR9zCT8upvD6p/69a2792930324b869e5b4bd3ddf9c37d/logo.svg","year":2024,"subtitle":"B2B Platform","oneLineDescription":"A way for green energy companies to connect.","shortDescription":"Bridges is a platform that allows green energy companies to register with their corporate accounts and allow their team to partner and reach out to other companies in the sector giving them the ability to form corporate bonds.","projectDetails":"The idea stemmed from the fact that many companies keep lists of team members at other companies they are cooperating with. With Bridges, people would no longer have to scour through internal documents to find out who they should contact. Partnering with other businesses would allow you to see a full list of team members for that company, allowing you to view an email list along with allowing you to see the roles everyone at the company has, making it easy to locate and contact specific people immediately.\n\\n\nBridges is being developed with NextJS 13, Lucia Auth, Chakra UI and MongoDB. We figured that over the course of time, our database schemas would become less structured as things like internal dashboard and messaging systems would be developed so instead of choosing something like PostgreSQL, we chose MongoDB. Even though Lucia is a relatively new project for managing authentication, we still chose to incorporate it into the project instead of choosing something like Auth.js which gives you much less control over your authentication flow.

It features a polymorphic design for flexible component usage, an automated color palette for dynamic UI theming, and extensive documentation for a better developer experience.","projectDetails":"Developing DecaUI was primarily a way for me to experiment with building accessible components from scratch while also learning how to write structured integration and unit tests for frontend components. \n\\n\nAt the time, StitchesJS offered the best-in-class developer experience as it took a completely different approach to styling components than more popular libraries such as Styled Components or EmotionJS. The main issue with these other libraries was that designing these components versus writing them was a completely different game. StitchesJS attempted to bridge this gap between component design and writing styles by implementing variants allowing for a more effective approach to styling React applications.\n\\n\nHowever, the birth of NextJS 13 and React Server Components started the slow decline in styling libraries that didn't support static CSS extraction meaning that it was only a matter of time before StitchesJS would become a dead project, and in February of 2023, it was confirmed that StitchesJS would no longer be maintained, DecaUI followed shortly after.\n\\n\nIf I had to do it all over again, I'd most-likely stick with a more robust and backed library that supports static extraction like Panda CSS and go for a library that handles accessibility for me like React Aria or Radix UI.","url":"https://www.deca-ui.com/","githubUrl":"https://github.com/deca-org/deca-ui"},{"title":"MyHomely","slug":"myhomely","wip":false,"cover":"https://images.ctfassets.net/51r7zajk5f2o/5BByXNBJgCFjcy5BaYgA4S/fb181e04592f0fcab2c89bfa74abcacc/Homely_1.png","icon":"https://images.ctfassets.net/51r7zajk5f2o/40nNfUKSYc6cCnkZRqu3UA/7b54aa032a0eae4a971f9a273098eb14/logo_1.png","year":2021,"subtitle":"Real estate startup","oneLineDescription":"A startup that allowed people to scout, purchase, and sell homes online.","shortDescription":"MyHomely was a fintech startup that aimed at allowing people to make estimates on how much their home cost, allowed them to browse houses for sale, and sell their property.","projectDetails":"The project was a MERN application built with NextJS 10 and ExpressJS taking advantage of libraries like Stripe, Formik, Nivo, and Material UI.

One of the more complicated features was an e-contract system built with PandaDoc that allowed negotiations between homebuyers and sellers to occur online. \n\\n\nThe application used Redux for state management as well as the Google Maps API to serve the locations of these houses listed for sale as well as the distance between them and nearby schools, hospitals, and other relevant infrastructure.\n\\n\nMyHomely was deployed and demoed using AWS EC2 and S3 buckets for image hosting.
